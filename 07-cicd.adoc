= Creating a Pipeline

== Creating a Pipeline

In this lab, we will learn to create a build pipeline on OpenShift. This
pipeline will be setup using Jenkins running as an application pod on
OpenShift. The pipeline running on Jenkins will trigger builds and
deployments on OpenShift.

=== Prerequisites:

  * You need a github account if you want to make changes and test the pipeline kick-off.
  * You will be using the projects you created in the "Promoting Applications" lab.

=== Create Project
IMPORTANT: Please replace *Username* with your username

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- Click `Developer` under `Administrator` to switch to Developer persona
- Click onto `Project` on the top
- Click `Create Project`

image::dev-project.png[image]

- Enter *pipeline-Username* as name of the project. The display name and description is optional.

=== Deploy OOTB Jenkins

- Navigate to `+Add`
- Click on `From Catalog`

image::from-catalog.png[image]

- Check the `checkbox` next to `Template`
- Enter `Jenkins` in the `Filter by keyword`

image::pick-templates.png[image]

- Click `Jenkins (Ephemeral)`
- Click `Instantiate Template`
- Take the default values and click `Create`
- Navigate to `Topology`
- Click onto the middle of the Jenkins icon to see the details
- Wait for the solid blue ring shows on the icon
- Click onto the route link to go to Jenkins Console

image::route-link.png[image]

- Click `Advanced`
- Click the link where it shows `Proceed to jenkins-...`
- Click `Log in with OpenShift`

image::jenkins-login.png[image]

- Click `htpasswd`
- Login using your user name
- Click `Allow selected permissions`
- You now login the Jenkins console

=== Deploy your CI/CD tool (Jenkins)

- Login {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- From `Developer` persona
- Click on `+Add` on the left menu
- Click `YAML`
- Enter the following in the text area

```
kind: BuildConfig
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: myfirstpipeline
  labels:
    name: myfirstpipeline
  annotations:
    pipeline.alpha.openshift.io/uses: '[{"name": "myphp", "namespace": "", "kind": "DeploymentConfig"}]'
spec:
  triggers:
    -
      type: GitHub
      github:
        secret: secret101
    -
      type: Generic
      generic:
        secret: secret101
  runPolicy: Serial
  source:
    type: None
  strategy:
    type: JenkinsPipeline
    jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
      jenkinsfile: "node() {\nstage 'build'\nopenshiftBuild(buildConfig: 'myphp', showBuildLogs: 'true')\nstage 'deploy'\nopenshiftDeploy(deploymentConfig: 'myphp')\nopenshiftScale(deploymentConfig: 'myphp',replicaCount: '2')\n}"
  output:
  resources:
  postCommit:
```

  Note that the build configuration uses `JenkinsPipelineStrategy`. Also
  the `spec.strategy.jenkinsPipelineStrategy.jenkinsfile` is the actual
  pipeline that runs. We will discuss that in the next step.

=== Create projects & Permissions and Configuration Changes


The Jenkins user in the jenkins project you created needs to have access to the
projects `development-UserName` and `testing-UserName`. Just for testing; we
will give jenkins full access to these projects.

- Go to terminal
- Login via `oc login -u Userxx {{API_URL}}`
- Execute the following OC commands

```
oc new-project testing-UserName
oc new-project development-UserName
oc adm policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:testing-UserName -n development-UserName
oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin system:serviceaccount:pipeline-UserName:jenkins -n development-UserName
oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin system:serviceaccount:pipeline-UserName:jenkins -n testing-UserName
oc project development-UserName
oc new-app openshift/php~https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/welcome-php
```

For reference the syntax is: `system:serviceaccount:PROJECTNAME:SERVICEACCOUNT`

=== Updating the pipeline

- From `Developer` persona
- Click `Builds`
- Click on BuildConfig `myfirstpipeline`
- Under the `Overview` tab, you can see the details about the pipeline
- Click `YAML` tab
- Edit the current content of `jenkinsfile` with the following.
**Please update `UserName` to your username**

```
strategy:
  type: JenkinsPipeline
  jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
    jenkinsfile: |-
    node() {
      stage 'build'
      sh 'oc start-build welcome-php -n development-UserName'
      stage 'deploy'
      sh 'oc rollout latest welcome-php -n development-UserName'
      stage 'cleanup testing'
      sh 'oc delete all --all -n testing-UserName'
      stage 'deployInTesting'
      input 'Promote Dev Image to Testing?'
      sh 'oc tag development-UserName/welcome-php:latest testing-UserName/welcome-php:promote-qa'
      sh 'oc new-app testing-UserName/welcome-php:promote-qa -n testing-UserName'
      sh 'oc scale --replicas=3 dc welcome-php -n testing-UserName'
      }
```

- Click `Save`. (Make sure you change the values according to your configuration)


=== Disable Deployment Trigger

- From the top, select `development-UserName` project
- Click `Topology`
- Click onto the middle icon of `welcome-php`
- Click `DC welcome-php` from the top of detail page
- Click `YAML`
- Search for `automatic` and update the `automatic: true` to `automatic: false`
as shown below.

```
triggers:
    - type: ConfigChange
    - type: ImageChange
      imageChangeParams:
        automatic: false
```
- Click `Save`

=== Start Pipeline

- From the top, select `pipeline-UserName` project
- Click `Builds`
- Click onto `myfirstpipeline`
- Click `Actions` --> `Start Build`
- Click `View Logs`

image::myfirstpipeline.png[image]

- Click `Input Required` link under `deployInTesting` stage
- You will give redirect to the Jenins Console
- Click `Open Blue Ocean` on the left menu

image::blueocean.png[image]

- After few seconds, the pipeline is completed

image::pipeline-completed.png[image]

- Go back to OpenShift Console, `Developer` persona
- Click to go to `testing-Username` project
- The deployment automatically scale up to 3 pods

=== Configure webhook and trigger with changes (optional)

- Go back to the build pipeline `myfirstpipeline`
- Click `YAML`
- The following is the configuration of webhook for the BuildConfig

```
triggers:
    - type: GitHub
      github:
        secret: secret101
    - type: Generic
      generic:
        secret: secret101
```
- Click `Overview` tab and scroll down the page

image::webhook.png[image]

- Click `Copy URL with Secret` for `Github webhook`
- Use this URL to configure your github repo to trigger the pipeline

=== Setting it up from github (*BONUS* if you update the build to use your forked git repo)
Based on what you learn in the past, go to your github repository that
you cloned and set up a webhook pointing to this URL.

- Navigate to `Settings` -> `Webhooks` on your project in github
- Set the `Payload URL` to `Github Webhook` URL noted above
- Make sure the `Content Type` is set to `application/json`
- Press on `Disable SSL`
- Press on `Add Webhook`

Now edit the one of the file in your repo and `Commit` changes.
Pipeline build will be triggered.

Come back and watch the Web Console, you will notice that a new build
has just started. Once the build completes, you will also see the
rolling deployment of the pods.

Congratulations!! In this lab, you have learnt how to set up and run
your own CI/CD pipeline on OpenShift.
