= Adding a backend database to the SpringBoot application

== Adding a backend database to the SpringBoot application

In this exercise we will add a backend database to the previous deployed
SpringBoot application.

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

If you already created the SpringBoot application in the previous lab, just test one more thing. Try your application url
with `/dbtest` (http://bootapp-spring-userxx.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}/dbtest) extension and it should list you some data from
the HSQLDB configured within the same app.

Let's take a moment to understand how this application is connecting to
the HSQLDB. Look at the `application.properties` file in the code
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/application.properties
and we have configured these spring datasource variables to use hsqldb.


```
spring.datasource.platform=hsqldb
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:hsqldb:file:/opt/app-root/src/mydb;shutdown=true
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password

```

Of course,
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/pom.xml
has the required dependencies. So springboot is able to create the in
memory database.

Where is the data coming from? See these two files:

* https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema-hsqldb.sql
is creating the schema
* https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/data-hsqldb.sql
is adding data.

This is the data displayed when you invoke dbtest endpoint. Pretty
straight forward.. isn't it!!

In this lab, we will deploy the same as a 2-tier application by adding a
MySQL database running as a separate pod.

=== Add a MySQL database to this project

Based on what you learnt in the previous labs, you know what to do!!

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

- Go to {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Make sure you are in the `java-userxx` project where your springboot
application is running.
- Switch to `Developer` persona if you have not
- Click `+Add` on the left menu
- Click `Database`

image::database.png[image]

- select `MySQL Ephemeral` from the catalog

image::mysql.png[image]

- Click `Instantiate Templates`
- Enter the following details:

  * Database Service Name:* mysql
  * MySQL Connection Username:* user
  * MySQL Connection Password:* password
  * MySQL Database Name:* sampledb
  * Version of MySQL Image: 5.7

_Feel free to use your own values, but make a note of the same_ (write
down..we will need these)

- Click on the `Create`
- Click `Topology` on the left menu
- Wait for the solid blue show up for mysql, it means it is real

=== Configuring database connection parameters

The simplest way is to edit `application.properties` file to the values
you noted in the last step i.e.

```
spring.datasource.platform=mysql
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-userxx:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
```

But wait, that requires you to rebuild he code and deploy.

So, is there another way?.. *Yes* Let's use a `ConfigMap`.

ConfigMaps allow you to keep the configuration artifacts decoupled from
the image content. More details
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/configmaps.html[here].
We will see use them here and understand their _flexibility_ in the next
lab.

Lets go to CLI.

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

- Change to `java-userxx` project

  ```
  oc project java-userxx
  ```

- Create a new local file with name `application.properties` with the following
content.

  ```
  spring.datasource.platform=mysql
  spring.datasource.url= jdbc:mysql://mysql.java-userxx:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
  spring.datasource.username=user
  spring.datasource.password=password
  ```

- Service Naming Convention
  You need to make sure that you substitute the correct values you noted in the
  last step when you are creating the service. *Be extra-careful..read instructions below.*

  Specifically note the datasource url. It is in the following format:

  `spring.datasource.url = jdbc:<<databasetype>>://<<service-host>>:<<service-port>>/<<dbname>>?useSSL=false`

  You can replace `service-host` by the IP address of your MySQL service
  or the Service name. In the above example, I am using the service name
  for example `mysql.java-userxx`. Here `mysql` is the name of the
  service and `java-userxx` is the project name. This is a fully
  qualified way to let your application do service discovery in OpenShift.

- Create a ConfigMap with name `app-props`

  ```
  $ oc create configmap app-props --from-file=application.properties
  configmap "app-props" created
  ```

- Let's take a look at the configmap details

  ```
  $ oc describe configmap app-props
  Name:         app-props
  Namespace:    java-project
  Labels:       <none>
  Annotations:  <none>

  Data
  ====
  application.properties:
  ----
  spring.datasource.platform=mysql
  spring.datasource.url= jdbc:mysql://mysql.java-project:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
  spring.datasource.username=user
  spring.datasource.password=password

  Events:  <none>
  ```

- Edit the ConfigMap using when it is needed

  ```
  oc edit configmap app-props
  ```

=== Edit Deployment Configuration

So far, we have created a ConfigMap in the project but your springboot
application does not know how to use it.

=== Mounting the ConfigMap

Now we will mount the ConfigMap so that the springboot application can
use it. You can either edit from CLI or from WebConsole.

=== From Web console

- Go to `Developer` persona
- Click `Topology` on left menu
- Click on the middle `springbootapp` icon to get to the details
- Click onto `DC springbootapp` on the top of the details page
- Click `YAML`
- Scroll down to container spec, that looks like this:

  ```
      spec:
      containers:
        - name: springbootapp
          image: >-
            image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/java-project/springbootapp@sha256:0bea0c6eaaf4acb1fe09319b4f0f99cceffb03aa7bfb727b87742b9419ab3a93
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              protocol: TCP
          resources: {}
          terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
          terminationMessagePolicy: File
          imagePullPolicy: Always
      restartPolicy: Always
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      securityContext: {}
      schedulerName: default-scheduler
  ```

  Note there could be multiple `spec`s in your DC. Look for the one with `containers`

- Add a volume that points to our ConfigMap right under `spec`. It is explained here
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/configmaps.html#configmaps-use-case-consuming-in-volumes

  ```
  spec:
    volumes:
      - name: app-props-volume
        configMap:
          name: app-props
  ```

  WARNING: Be super-careful with indentation

- Add `volumeMount` to mount the `volume` that we just added into the pod.
It should be right under the container `name:` as shown below.

  ```
        containers:
          -
            name: springbootapp
            volumeMounts:
            - name: app-props-volume
              mountPath: /opt/app-root/src/config
  ```

  WARNING: Be super-careful with indentation

After the changes, the `template` section in the dc, should now look
like this

  ```
    template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: springbootapp
        deploymentconfig: springbootapp
      annotations:
        openshift.io/generated-by: OpenShiftNewApp
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: app-props-volume
          configMap:
            name: app-props
            defaultMode: 420
      containers:
        - name: springbootapp
          image: >-
            image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/java-project/springbootapp@sha256:0bea0c6eaaf4acb1fe09319b4f0f99cceffb03aa7bfb727b87742b9419ab3a93
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              protocol: TCP
          resources: {}
          volumeMounts:
            - name: app-props-volume
              mountPath: /opt/app-root/src/config
          terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
          terminationMessagePolicy: File
          imagePullPolicy: Always
      restartPolicy: Always
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      securityContext: {}
      schedulerName: default-scheduler
  ```

- Using OC CLI to add ConfigMap
  *Optional:* you can run the following to do the update on the deploymentConfig:

  ```
   oc set volumes dc/springbootapp --add -m /opt/app-root/src/config --configmap-name=app-props
  ```

- where does the application.properties go?
  Since the mount path is `/opt/app-root/src/config`?

- From `DC springbootapp`, click `Pods`
- Click onto the name of pod
- Click `Terminal` to get to the container
- Type: cd /opt/app-root/src/config
- Run the following commands

```
$ ls config
application.properties
$ cat config/application.properties
spring.datasource.platform=mysql
spring.datasource.url= jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-userxx:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
```

Note the contents of this file are what you added to the ConfigMap.

=== Test your application*

Go back to the `Overview` page. Click on your application url which
would be something like
`http://springbootapp-java-spring-userxx.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}/`

It will open a new tab and your running application will greet you

`Hello from springbootapp-2-06a4b`

Now move back to your webconsole and watch the pod logs. You can also do
this from CLI by running

```
oc logs -f springbootapp-2-06a4b (please use you pod name from your project!!)
```

Now access the application with the `/dbtest` extension -
`http://springbootapp-java-userxx.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}/dbtest`

It should show the data from your MySQL database.

```
Customers List


CustomerId: 2 Customer Name: Joe Mysql Age: 88
CustomerId: 3 Customer Name: Jack Mysql Age: 54
CustomerId: 4 Customer Name: Ann Mysql Age: 32
```

Where did this data come from? Look at *
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema-mysql.sql
was used to initialize the MySQL database *
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/data-mysql.sql
was used to populate data. I added 'Mysql' as part of the names to make
it easy ;)

Also note that your logs show the connection url, just to verify which
database you are connecting to.

```
connection url: jdbc:mysql://mysql.java-userxx:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
```

=== Secure your Credentials

You may wonder if you can have a more secure way to configure the database
username and password for the application deployment. Let me show you have to
create secret for your database.

- From `Administrator` persona
- Click `Workloads` -> Click `Secrets`
- Click `Create` -> Select `Key/Value` Secrets

image::key-value-secret.png[image]

- Enter information for `Secret Name`, `Key` and `Value`

image::db-secret.png[image]

- Click `Create`
- Click `Add Secret to Workload` on the top right corner
- Select `DC springbootapp` from `Add this secret to workload`
- Select `Volume`
- Enter `MouthPath` as `/opt/app-root/src/database-config`

image::secret-workload.png[image]

- Click `Save`
- Application is automatically redeploy when configuration is updated. You will
see new Pod is starting and the old pod is terminating.
- Click `Pods` tab under `DC springbootapp`
- Click onto the new pod
- Click `Terminal` tab
- Type: cd /opt/app-root/src/database-config && ls
- Type cat mysql-info

The secret is created and mounted a volume to the pod. The application can use
the credential from this local configuration.
From here, you can modify your application to use the database credential
instead of the application.properties.

In this lab exercise, you have learnt how to set up a multi-tiered
application and also to pass configuration information using ConfigMaps.
In the next lab, we will learn to use ConfigMaps to dynamically update
the configuration without restarting the pod!!
