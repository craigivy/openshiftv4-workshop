== Build Spring Boot Application

In this exercise we will deploy a Java application

=== Create Project
IMPORTANT: Please replace *Username* with your username

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- Click `Developer` under `Administrator` to switch to Developer persona
- Click onto `Project` on the top
- Click `Create Project`

- Enter *java-Username* as name of the project. The display name and description is optional.

We want to use the S2I image directly from a external registry
that is outside OpenShift environment. The Spring Boot image was not in
the catalog. In this lab, we will learn how to add the Spring Boot image
to the project catalog so that you can deploy the application directly
from your screen.

=== Add the Spring Boot image stream.

We will use the image stream from the following YAML

....
{
    "kind": "ImageStream",
    "apiVersion": "image.openshift.io/v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "springboot"
    },
    "spec": {
        "tags": [
            {
                "name": "latest",
                "annotations": {
                    "description": "Spring Boot S2I Image CentOS based",
                    "iconClass": "icon-jboss",
                    "tags": "builder,springboot,java,maven",
                    "supports": "springboot,java:8,maven",
                    "version": "1.0"
                },
            "from": {
              "kind": "DockerImage",
              "name": "docker.io/veermuchandi/spring-mvn-base:latest"
            }
            }
        ]
    }
}
....

Notice, that this json points to the Spring Boot S2I builder Image on
docker hub.

You have two ways to add this to the catalog.
1. Add from command line
2. Add using the web console

=== To add using CLI run the `oc create` command:

....
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piggyvenus/openshiftv4-workshop/ocp4.2/springboot.json
imagestream "springboot" created
....

Check by running `oc get is`

You can also search your spring boot image by running the following
command:

....
$ oc new-app --search springboot
Image streams (oc new-app --image-stream=<image-stream> [--code=<source>])
-----
springboot
  Project: java-project
  Tags:    latest
....

'''''

=== To add using the web console,

- Select `+Add` from the left menu
- Click `YAML` from the selection
- Copy paste the above imagestream contents into the text box
- Click `Create` button.

=== Deploy application

Now it is time to create your application and use the Spring Boot S2I image to deploy your sample Spring Boot application
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app
....
$ oc new-app springboot~https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app --name=springbootapp
--> Found image c3ddd9e (2 years old) in image stream "java-project/springboot" under tag "latest" for "springboot"

    Spring Boot Maven 3
    -------------------
    Platform for building and running Spring Boot applications

    Tags: builder, java, java8, maven, maven3, springboot

    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "springbootapp:latest"
      * Use 'oc start-build' to trigger a new build
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "springbootapp"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "springbootapp"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "springbootapp"

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "springbootapp" created
    buildconfig.build.openshift.io "springbootapp" created
    deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "springbootapp" created
    service "springbootapp" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/springbootapp' to track its progress.
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/springbootapp'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
....


=== Developer Console

- Go to Web Console
- Switch to `Developer` persona
- Click `Builds` on the left menu
- Click `springbootapp` build config
- Click `Builds` tab
- Click `springbootapp-1`
- Click `Logs` tab -> scroll to the bottom
- If you see `Push successful`, it means build has completed.

- Click `Topology` on the left menu
- Click onto the center of the springboot icon
- Click `view logs` to view log from the Java process

=== Create Route from a Service

A service is a grouping of pods that are running on the cluster based on a set
of labels (selector). Services provide important features that are standardized
across the cluster: internal load-balancing, service discovery between
applications, and features to support zero-downtime application deployments.
Backing pods can be added to or removed from a service arbitrarily while the
service remains consistently available, enabling anything that depends on the
service to refer to it at a consistent address.
Services are assigned an IP address and port pair that, when accessed, proxy to
an appropriate backing pod.


A router uses the service selector to find the service and the endpoints backing
the service. When both router and service provide load balancing, OpenShift
Container Platform uses the router load balancing. A router detects relevant
changes in the IP addresses of its services and adapts its configuration accordingly.

- Use terminal to login
....
$ oc project
$ oc get svc
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
springbootapp   ClusterIP   172.30.107.19   <none>        8080/TCP   107m
$ oc expose svc springbootapp
route.route.openshift.io/springbootapp exposed
....

=== Check the Route

- From `Developer` persona
- Click `Topology`
- Click on the route link from the springboot icon

- Congratulations! You have deployed a Java Spring Boot Application.

=== Debugging Application
You may wonder how do we debug the application on the container platform.
Now, let take a look at the OpenShift's aggregated logging console.

- Go to the web console {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Make sure you are using `Developer` persona
- Click `Topology`
- Click on the name of the pod on the details
- Click `Actions` -> `Delete Pod`
- Wait for the pod to come up as `Running`
- Click `Actions` -> `Delete Pod`
- Switch to `Administrator` persona
- Click `Monitoring` on the left menu
- Click `Logging` to access the Logging Console
- Click `htpasswd` to login using your username and Password
- Click `Allow selected permissions`
- you should get to a screen as shown below

image::kibana.png[image]

NOTE: if nothing show, pick a 1 hour time range instead

- Under `Available Fields`, click `add` next to `kubernetes.namespace_name`

image::available-fields.png[image]

- Click `add` next to `message`
- Click `Add a filter +` on the top
- Add filter to search for `message` `is one of` `Started` as shown below

image::add-filter.png[image]

- Click `Save`
- Search result is shown as below.

With the aggregated logging, you will be able to see not only the logs from current running pod and also all the logs from the application. Also, logging is fully integrated with the RABC on OpenShift.
